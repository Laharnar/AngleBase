Space-shooter multiplayer game with multiple modes.

initial commit - 22.5.2022
Intended to be small multiplayer game, I made in between jobs. Player would use their small ship to defend their mothership, and destroy the enemy base.
Initial idea came from Star wars, initial scene in third movie - Revenge of the sith, where 2 large ships obliterate each other while tons of 
smallfighters right around thhem.

Once it's up I might add modding, which would enable players to add their own modes.
